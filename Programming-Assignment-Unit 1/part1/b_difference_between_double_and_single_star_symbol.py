print(6**6)
print(6*6)

# Explanation of the Difference
# The single star * and double star ** are two completely different operators in Python.
# 1. The Single Star * (Asterisk) Operator
#     Purpose: It is the multiplication operator.
#     Function: It is used for multiplying two numbers together.
#     Example: 6 * 6 means 6 multiplied by 6.
#     Calculation: 6 * 6 = 36
# In simple terms: The single * is for basic multiplication, just like in standard math.

# 2. The Double Star ** Operator
#     Purpose: It is the exponentiation operator.
#     Function: It is used to raise a number to a power. The expression x ** y means "x raised to the power of y".
#     Example: 6 ** 6 means 6 to the power of 6.
#     Calculation: 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 46656
# In simple terms: The double ** means "to the power of." It tells Python to multiply the first number by itself, a number of times equal to the second number.

# Why This Happened: The Technical Reason
# Python's interpreter reads the symbols * and ** as distinct commands with different meanings defined in the language's core syntax.
#     When it sees 6 * 6, it calls the multiplication operation.
#     When it sees 6 ** 6, it calls the exponentiation (power) operation.
# They are different symbols that trigger completely different mathematical procedures, which is why the results are vastly different.
